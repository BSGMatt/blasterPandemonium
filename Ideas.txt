///Blasters: Pandemonium Ideas Page
1)Make ammo finite and instead have the player build an ammo generator
	-Crystal can generate ammo much like an Dispenser from TF2
2)Flamethrower block / weapon
	-Excels at hitting multiple targets at once, but lacks burst damage
	-Maybe replace the speed-modifier blocks with flamethrower
	-That or SEE (4)
3)Redesign the map to feature permanent sold environment. 
4)Redesign the Slime and Dashpad blocks to be turret-based
	-The slime blocks shoot bullets at enemies that do a
	little damage, but slow them down temporarily.
