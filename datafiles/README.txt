Blasters: Pandemonium is a survival arcade top-down shooter. Your main goal is to survive for a total of 30 WAVES.
After every few wave the difficulty increases; enemies deal more damage and have more health, bosses get faster and stronger, etc.

NAVIGATING THE MENU:
Upon booting the game, you are given a menu with the title screen and three options:
START - This starts a new game from the beginning. 
LOAD - Loads a previous game. NOTE: All saved games will start at the preparation phase of the wave you saved at, regardless of which phase you saved. 

GAMEPLAY:
Each wave is seperated into 3 main PHASES:
**PREPARATION PHASE - In this phase, you must build defenses to protect the CRYSTAL in the center. Protecting the crystal is important, for it is the only way you can respawn after dying. In the prep phase, you have access to the SHOP. While in the SHOP, you can buy several item that will help with your defenses. 
	*There are TWO main types of items: WEAPONS, and BLOCKS. 
	*Weapons are your main tool for attacking enemies. All have there strengths and weaknesses, however, more powerful weapons are generally more expensive. 
	*You can access the "WEAPONS" section of the SHOP by clicking the "TO WEAPONS" BUTTON towards the bottom of your screen. Similarly, you can use the "TO BLOCKS" BUTTON to access the "BLOCKS" section. 
	*Blocks provide a method of directly protecting you and especially your crystal. While some blocks can block damage, other blocks can block damage or modifiy the direction or speed of a projectile. 

**SWARM PHASE - The main phase, where ENEMIES spawn and attack you or the crystal. Your main goal is to simply survive. Each phase has a certain amount of enemies that need to be destroyed in order to complete the phase. 
	*Enemies will get more challenging as the game continues. 
	*Enemies will drop MONEY once defeated. This money can be used to buy items in the next WAVE.
	*Enemies have either TWO main functions:
		*A) Target and shoot the player (aka YOU), OR
		*B) Dart torward the Crystal and shoot at it.
	*It's important to note that the Crystal does regenerate health and has its own weapon to shoot enemies with. 

BOSS PHASE - After you have defeated all of the enemies in the attack phase, a BOSS will spawn. You must defeat the boss in order to proceed to the next wave.
	*The boss will drop a large amount of money once defeated.
